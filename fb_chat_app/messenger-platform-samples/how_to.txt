To "deploy"
- this is in hacktech/HackTech_2017/fb_chat_app/messenger-platform-samples/node directory
- Make sure everything the config file (default.json) is right
- run the bot with node.js (the bot is currently configured to run on localhost:5000)
	node app.js
- use ngrok to forward localhost to public internet
	- will have to make sure the webhook url on the FB application dashboard is right, since 
	  ngrok gives a new url each time.
